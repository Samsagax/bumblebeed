Version 3.0 - 19 January 2012

Highlights:
- [new] bbswitch power management, allows for fast and reliable power switching
  which also survives suspend
- [new] vga_switcheroo power management is supported but only available for
   nouveau.
- [new] by default the card is switched off if no optirun program is using it.
- [new] Better detection of errors as well as reporting those to the user
  running optirun.
- [new] Automatically detect the correct PCI Bus ID, removing the need for
  manual configuration.
- [new] recovery from drivers getting loaded while the card is off which would
  result in "No such device" errors (nvidia).
- [new] Standard autotools build system, allowing for better dependency
  checking and a more comfortable way to install/uninstall the program.
- [new] manual pages for optirun (a client) and bumblebeed (the daemon/server)
- [new] optirun --status will now show the current status of Bumblebee and the
  secondary GPU on your system.
- [new] Includes example initscripts for SysV init, systemd and Upstart.
- [enhancement] More reliable detection of the availability and status of the
  secondary X server.
- [enhancement] New configuration file format and options which groups settings
  for the daemon, optirun and drivers.
- [enhancement] Xorg configuration greatly simplified, provided defaults
  usually work out of the box.
- [enhancement] Complete rewrite of server/client in C
- [enhancement] Better integration with the system using standard libraries.
- [enhancement] Logging is done through syslog which allows for having the
  kernel and daemon messages in one file.
- [bugfix] failure when starting optirun quickly after the last instance exited
   has been fixed.

Upgrade notes for 2.4.x users:
- EcoMode has temporary been removed which means that the card will be used by
  optirun even when running on battery.
- The following options are dropped from optirun:
  - `-f`: EcoMode is not available with this release.
  - `-32`: already deprecated in version 2.4 as it does nothing.
  - `--debug-log`: manually set VGL_VERBOSE=1 and VGL_LOG=filename to achieve
    the same behavior.
- The option `--failsafe=Y` and `--failsafe=N` has been changed to `--failsafe`
  and `--no-failsafe` (it does not accept an option anymore)
- The Bumblebee daemon is now named "bumblebeed" instead of just "bumblebee".
- The option `-d` does not daemonize `bumblebeed`, but changes the
  VirtualDisplay setting. Use `-D` or `--daemon` instead.
- The format of configuration file bumblebee.conf has changed in v3.0+ and is
  not backwards compatible (see
  https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bumblebeed/wiki/Configuration for
  details). Important: quotes around values are **not** supported. For example,
  use Driver=nouveau instead of Driver='nouveau'.
- cardon/cardoff scripts cannot be used anymore; the potentional dangerous
  acpi_call method has been removed in favor of bbswitch.
- since we're using syslog, messages are no longer logged to
  /var/log/bumblebee.log. Instead, look for /var/log/syslog or similar.

Other notes:
- bbswitch is independent of the driver; vga_switcheroo works for nouveau only.
  See also the Known Issues section above and
  https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Comparison-of-PM-methods
- the video drivers must be unloadable. This means that it should not be
  compiled into the kernel. When using dynamically built modules like nvidia,
  be sure that the toolchain used for building the kernel matches the one that
  is used for building the module. This means that Ubuntu mainline kernels do
  not work and will cause crashes.
- Certain machines need the "ConnectedMonitor" setting to be changed if using
  the nvidia driver. optirun will inform you if this change is neccesary on
  your machine, as well as report a value that should work and what file to
  edit.
- VirtualGL performance is very dependent on the Transport method set. The
  default "proxy" setting appears to perform bad in some situations. Try other
  available settings like "rgb" or "yuv".
- The cleanup script has been removed. Users who have used MrMEEE/bumblebee or
  Ironhide need to reboot after removal those programs.
- Do not combine power management methods (i.e. bbswitch with the deprecated
  acpi_call), it does not save more power and will break your machine.

Known issues:
- vga-switcheroo needs kernel patching and won't survive suspension/hibernation
  (newer Optimus machines need patching for OFF even to work, this has been
  accepted for Kernel 3.3; a good patch for suspend is still being prepared).
- bbswitch (and acpi_call) cannot disable the discrete nvidia card for the Dell
  Vostro 360 desktop with Synergy. If you have a machine using that technology,
  please submit your machine information on
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/752542
- VGA button (if present) will not change from color after switching and 
  pushing it has no effect.
- After a configuration change in drivers, the daemon needs to be restarted for
  the changes to take effect. However, optirun reads the configuration
  immediately which may cause unexpected behavior.
- The Lenovo Y470 and Y570 are neither supported by bbswitch nor the video
  drivers. See https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bbswitch/issues/2
